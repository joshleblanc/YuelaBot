# Quick Start

Click the gitpod button above to launch into a pre-configured cloud IDE. All you have to do is setup your bot token in .env, then run `bundle exec ruby main.rb`

# Prerequisites

* Ruby
* Postgres*

\* You can change the database driver in ./config/database.yml if you so desire. You'll need to include the
associated gem in the Gemfile as well.

# Installation instructions

`bundle install` will install the dependencies for the project

`rake db:create` will create the database

`rake db:migrate` will run the database migrations

# How to run

There needs to be a file called `config` in the `config` directory.
This file is functionally a .env file, with the following keys:

```
discord=<Your discord api key>
google=<A google api key>
search_id=<The search engine id for your custom search engine>
reddit_secret=<Reddit secret for .. reddit>
reddit_clientid=<Reddit api client id>
reddit_user=<Your reddit username>
reddit_pass=<Your reddit password>
admins=<A comma delimited list of discord user ids, who can do administration tasks on the bot>
open_weather_key=<An open weather map api key>
wordnik_key=<API key for wordnik>
github_access_token=<Access token for github, for submitting issues>
```


Once the file is there, you can run the bot with:

`bundle exec foreman start`


# Debugging

You can pause executation at any line by calling `byebug`.

You can read byebug's documentation here: https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug

Basically it pauses executation and drops you in a console in the execution context for you to play around in
